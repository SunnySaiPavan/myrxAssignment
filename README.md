i have taken inputs as lists
i converted every hour into minutes ("9:40" = 9*60+40) 
by converting i got the mintues and a single integer
i have checked if the arrival inputs length is not equal to depatures input length i have return 0
and if any of the arrival or depatures length is 0 i have return the value 0
